          <h1>IPv4 Variable Length Subnetting</h1>
          <hr>
          <p>Variable Length Subnet Mask (VLSM):  is a numerical masking sequence, or IP address subset, based on overall network requirements. A VLSM allows a network administrator to use long masks for networks with few hosts and short masks for networks with multiple hosts. A VLSM is used with a VLSM router and must have routing protocol support.
            A VLSM is also known as a classless Internet Protocol (IP) address.
            </p>
            <p>
              VLSM enables you to have more than one mask for a given class of address, albeit a class A, B, or C network number.
            </p>
            <p>
              VLSM, originally defined in RFC 1812, allows you to apply different subnet masks to the same class address space Classful protocols, such as RIPv1 and IGRP, do not support VLSM. To deploy VLSM requires a routing protocol that is classless—BGP, EIGRP, IS-IS, OSPF, or RIPv2, for instance.
            </p>
            <p>
              VLSM provides Two major advantages:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                more efficient use of addressing
              </li>
              <li>
                Ability to perform route summarization
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>when you perform classful subnetting, all subnets have the same number of hosts because they all use the same subnet mask. This leads to inefficiencies. For example, if you borrow 4 bits on a Class C network, you end up with 14 valid subnets of 14 valid hosts. A serial link to another router only needs 2 hosts, but with classical subnetting, you end up wasting 12 of those hosts. Even with the ability to use NAT and private addresses, where you should never run out of addresses in a network design, you still want to ensure that the IP plan that you create is as efficient as possible.</p>
            <p>
              Variable Length Subnet Masking (VLSM) is a way of further subnetting a subnet. Using Variable Length Subnet Masking (VLSM) we can allocate IPv4 addresses to the subnets by the exact need. Variable Length Subnet Masking (VLSM) allows us to use more than one subnet mask within the same network address space. If we recollect from the previous lessons, we can divide a network only into subnets with equal number of IPv4 addresses. Variable Length Subnet Masking (VLSM) allows to create subnets from a single network with unequal number of IPv4 addresses.

          <p>
            let’s take a look at the unsubnetted network topology from the scenario we’re going to be working with:
          </p>
          <img style="width:100%; height:80%;" src="../../assets/img/3-1pic.jpg"/>
          <br>
          <p>
            all 106 users in this network are on the same, single broadcast domain, any computer on any department can reach every other computer and there is one single point of failure which is Switch1 in the middle of the topology.
          </p>
          <p>
            before we move on to the actual practice, there are a couple of concepts that you need to take into consideration when working a subnetting scenario, They are:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>	
            Future growth space (Expandability).
            <br>
            When subnetting, you need to allocate space, not only for the number of current users, but also for any expected future growth (both users and/or network equipment).
            </li>
            <li>
                Router Topology:
                <br>
                The most common will be point-to-point links between routers, but whichever the case, you will need to allocate address space for them as well, for example, each point-to-point link is a single, 2 users subnet.

            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Practice</h2>
          <p>
              You are in charge of a network that allows a total of 254 (256-2) users (192.168.10.0/24), but the company has a total of 106 employees; 4 in HR, 4 in Accounting, 2 in Legal, 11 in IT, 55 in Sales and 30 in the Warehouse. You need to create subnets that would allow for these number of users and prevent the waste of IP addresses as much as possible.
          </p>
          <hr>
          <hr>
          <p>The scenario tells us that we need to create subnets that would allow a specific number of users, so in this particular scenario, we should end up with a total of 6 subnets, and each should allow the indicated number of users</p>

              let’s find out how we got there.

          <p>In this case, because these is the Sales subnet, the expected growth is high, so we are going to leave plenty of room, say 60 addresses. So:</p>
          <br>
          <p>55 users + 60 for future growth= 115</p>

          <p>Here is the number of bits needed to get to decimal 115. This means that you don’t even have to convert the whole number, once you find the first bit (the underlined 1 in this case), you can just count the remaining bits. So, 7 bits are needed to get to decimal 115.</p>

                  <br>In other words, the first subnets goes from 192.168.10.0 to 192.168.10.127, and the second subnet starts at 192.168.10.128. Like this:

          <p>For the second subnet, the Warehouse subnet, we are looking for 30 users, and since the warehouse employees will provably grow as well, we are going to leave 30 more addresses, so:</p>
